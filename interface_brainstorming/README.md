Interface Brainstorming
=======================

There are many different ways to formulate auto-tuning in Haskell,
especially if composability is a goal.

This directory contains a history of our different sketches on the
topic.  Some of these are just types, and some have some working
implementation code, but they are not ready to be used as libraries.

"02_monad-tune" is currently [2015.05.03] the most substantial of
these prototypes.
